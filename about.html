      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        Kids speak play, it's time we taught that way too. We teach life skills
        through games so kids can go on to be their most successful and confident
        selves.

            Rebecca is an ex-Uber and Microsoft PM and was a SWE intern at Apple.
            She double majored in SWE and Psych at Cal Poly. As the oldest of 4 kids
            she grew up going to her sisters’ occupational therapies, which
            inspired Fuzzy Feelings.
